Part A: First make sure there already is a user established in the database
        Run Assignment6/loginVuln.html...
        1. Enter this next part exactly in the double quotes "' OR User_ID=1 #"
        (The single quote breaks out of the SQL string, OR User_ID=1 targets the first user in the database,and # comments out 
        the rest of the query)
        
        2. Enter anything for the password and click sign in

        The vulnerable SQL query becomes SELECT User_ID, Username FROM User WHERE Email = '' OR User_ID=1 which will always 
        return the first user since User_ID=1 evaluates to true, completely bypassing authentication.

Part B: Make sure you have logged in from Assignment6/loginVuln.html
        1. Enter this next part exactly in the double quotes "' OR '1' = '1" to the current password
        The single quote breaks out of the SQL string, OR '1' = '1 makes the password statement always true

        2. Enter anything for the New Password and Confirm New Password (As long as they are the same) and click update password

        The vulnerable SQL query becomes UPDATE User SET Password = '[Whatever password you put]' WHERE (User_ID = '[Logged in user ID]') AND (Password = '1' = '1' #)
        SELECT User_ID, Username FROM User WHERE Email = '' OR User_ID=1 which will always
        return the first user since User_ID=1 evaluates to true, completely bypassing authentication.


        Notes: We use () in this in to make sure that only 1 user is changed.
        This is so that during the demo later we don't change all passwords instead of the specific users password.
        As such we cant use a # here at the end as that would remove the closing ) and cause an error.
        Also note that injecting in the "new password" field will change every single users password. So show this after the main demo is done.

Part C: How we have the login in process set up right now.
        Make sure you revert all changes made to index.html from part A before presenting
        (maybe keep the email input type to text just to show that the injection command wont work at all instead of it wont work
        beacuse its not in the form of an email)
